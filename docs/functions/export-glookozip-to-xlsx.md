# Export-GlookoZipToXlsx Function

The `Export-GlookoZipToXlsx` function is a PowerShell advanced function that converts a Glooko zip file to an Excel (XLSX) file. A Summary worksheet is created as the first tab containing an overview of all datasets, followed by each dataset in a separate worksheet, making it easy to analyze the data in Excel.

## Features

- **Summary Tab**: First worksheet contains an overview of all datasets with name, record count, and date information
- **Automated Conversion**: Automatically imports from ZIP and exports to Excel format
- **Multiple Worksheets**: Each dataset gets its own worksheet/tab in the Excel file
- **Automatic Naming**: Output file uses the same name as the ZIP file (with .xlsx extension)
- **Custom Output Path**: Optionally specify a custom location for the XLSX file
- **Formatted Tables**: Data is exported as Excel tables with formatting (Medium2 style)
- **Auto-sizing Columns**: Columns are automatically sized for readability (when supported)
- **Dataset Consolidation**: Leverages `Import-GlookoZip` to consolidate multiple files with matching metadata
- **Pipeline Support**: Accepts pipeline input for flexible usage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed progress information when using `-Verbose`

## Prerequisites

This function requires the **ImportExcel** PowerShell module to be installed. This module provides Excel file creation without requiring Microsoft Excel to be installed.

### Installing ImportExcel

```powershell
# Install from PowerShell Gallery (recommended)
Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser

# Or clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel.git
Import-Module ./ImportExcel/ImportExcel.psd1
```

## Usage

```powershell
# Basic usage - convert ZIP to XLSX in the same folder
Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip"
# Creates: C:\data\export.xlsx

# Specify custom output path
Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip" -OutputPath "C:\reports\mydata.xlsx"

# Pipeline usage
"C:\data\export.zip" | Export-GlookoZipToXlsx

# With verbose output
Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip" -Verbose
```

## Parameters

- **Path** (Mandatory): The path to the zip file to convert. Must be a file with a `.zip` extension. Supports pipeline input and validation.

- **OutputPath** (Optional): The full path for the output XLSX file. If not specified, the XLSX file will be created in the same folder as the ZIP file with the same name but `.xlsx` extension.

## Examples

**Example 1**: Convert a Glooko zip file to Excel
```powershell
$result = Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\glooko_export.zip"
Write-Host "Created: $($result.FullName)"
# Output: Created: C:\data\glooko_export.xlsx
```

**Example 2**: Specify a custom output location
```powershell
Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip" -OutputPath "D:\reports\analysis.xlsx"
```

**Example 3**: Pipeline processing of multiple zip files
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\data\exports" -Filter "*.zip" | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Converting: $($_.Name)"
    Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path $_.FullName
}
```

**Example 4**: Convert and open the file in Excel
```powershell
$result = Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip"
Invoke-Item $result.FullName  # Opens the XLSX file in Excel
```

**Example 5**: Process with verbose output
```powershell
Export-GlookoZipToXlsx -Path "C:\data\export.zip" -Verbose
# Shows detailed progress:
# VERBOSE: Starting Export-GlookoZipToXlsx function
# VERBOSE: Processing zip file: C:\data\export.zip
# VERBOSE: Importing data from zip file
# VERBOSE: Found 2 dataset(s) to export
# VERBOSE: Exporting dataset 'cgm' with 150 rows
# VERBOSE: Exporting dataset 'insulin' with 45 rows
# VERBOSE: Successfully created Excel file: C:\data\export.xlsx
```

**Example 6**: Batch conversion of all ZIP files in a folder
```powershell
$exportFolder = "C:\GlookoExports"
Get-ChildItem -Path $exportFolder -Filter "*.zip" | 
    Export-GlookoZipToXlsx

# All ZIP files are converted to XLSX in the same folder
```

## Output

Returns a `System.IO.FileInfo` object representing the created XLSX file. This object contains properties like:
- **FullName**: The complete path to the XLSX file
- **Name**: The filename with extension
- **Directory**: The directory containing the file
- **Length**: File size in bytes
- **Exists**: Boolean indicating if the file exists

## Worksheet Organization

The function creates a Summary worksheet followed by one worksheet per dataset:

### Summary Worksheet

The first worksheet is always named "Summary" and contains an overview of all datasets with the following columns:

- **Dataset**: The dataset name (from the CSV filename)
- **Records**: The number of data rows in the dataset
- **Name**: The name from the metadata (first line of CSV)
- **StartDate**: The start date from the metadata date range
- **EndDate**: The end date from the metadata date range

This provides a quick overview of all data in the export without needing to check individual worksheets.

### Data Worksheets

After the Summary worksheet, each dataset gets its own worksheet:

1. **Worksheet Names**: Based on the `Dataset` metadata property from the CSV filename
   - Example: `cgm_data_1.csv` â†’ worksheet named "cgm"
   - If no dataset name is available, uses "Sheet1", "Sheet2", etc.
   
2. **Name Sanitization**: Excel worksheet names have constraints:
   - Maximum 31 characters (automatically truncated if longer)
   - Cannot contain: `\ / ? * [ ] :` (automatically replaced with `_`)

3. **Table Formatting**: Each worksheet contains:
   - Data formatted as an Excel table
   - Medium2 table style applied
   - Auto-sized columns (when supported by the system)
   - Header row from the CSV data

4. **Empty Datasets**: Worksheets with no data are skipped with a warning

### Example Worksheet Structure

If a ZIP file contains these CSV files:
- `cgm_data_1.csv` (100 rows)
- `cgm_data_2.csv` (50 rows)  
- `insulin_data_1.csv` (30 rows)

With matching metadata in cgm files, the resulting XLSX will have:
- **Summary** worksheet: Overview of 2 datasets (cgm and insulin)
- **cgm** worksheet: 150 rows (consolidated from both cgm files)
- **insulin** worksheet: 30 rows

## How It Works

1. **Module Check**: Verifies ImportExcel module is available (either already loaded or can be loaded)
2. **Path Resolution**: Resolves the ZIP file path to an absolute path
3. **Output Path**: Determines the output XLSX path (default or custom)
4. **Import Data**: Uses `Import-GlookoZip` to extract and process all CSV files
5. **Summary Creation**: Generates summary data with dataset names, record counts, and date range metadata
6. **Summary Export**: Creates the Summary worksheet as the first tab
7. **Dataset Processing**: Iterates through each consolidated dataset
8. **Worksheet Creation**: Creates a worksheet for each dataset with:
   - Sanitized worksheet name
   - Formatted Excel table
   - Auto-sized columns
9. **File Overwrite**: If the XLSX file already exists, it is removed before creating the new one
10. **Return**: Returns the FileInfo object for the created XLSX file

## Related Functions

- **Import-GlookoZip**: Used internally to import data from the ZIP file. See [Import-GlookoZip documentation](import-glookozip.md) for details.
- **Import-GlookoFolder**: Used by `Import-GlookoZip` to process all CSV files. See [Import-GlookoFolder documentation](import-glookofolder.md) for details.
- **Import-GlookoCSV**: Used to process individual CSV files. See [Import-GlookoCSV documentation](import-glookocsv.md) for details.

## Error Handling

The function validates:
- The file exists
- The file has a `.zip` extension
- The file is not a folder
- The ImportExcel module is available

Common error messages:
- `File not found: <path>` - The specified zip file does not exist
- `File must have .zip extension: <path>` - The file is not a zip file
- `ImportExcel module not found` - The ImportExcel module is not installed
- `No data found in zip file: <path>` - Warning when the ZIP contains no CSV files
- `Dataset '<name>' has no data, skipping` - Warning when a dataset has no rows

### Handling Missing ImportExcel Module

If the ImportExcel module is not installed, you'll receive a helpful error message:

```
The ImportExcel module is required but not installed.

To install it, run one of the following commands:
  Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser
  
Or clone it from GitHub:
  git clone https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel.git
  Import-Module ./ImportExcel/ImportExcel.psd1

## Performance Notes

- The function creates the entire XLSX file in memory before writing to disk
- Large datasets may require significant memory
- Auto-sizing columns can be slow for very large datasets
- The output XLSX file is overwritten if it already exists
- Processing time depends on:
  - Number of datasets in the ZIP
  - Total number of rows across all datasets
  - System resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O)

## Limitations

- Requires ImportExcel module to be installed
- Excel worksheet names are limited to 31 characters
- Certain characters are not allowed in worksheet names
- Auto-sizing may not work on all operating systems (e.g., Linux without libgdiplus)
- Very large datasets may cause memory issues

## Tips

1. **Keep Worksheet Names Short**: If your dataset names are long, they will be truncated to 31 characters
2. **Check Dataset Names**: Use `Import-GlookoZip` first to see what datasets are in your ZIP
3. **Memory Usage**: For very large ZIP files, monitor memory usage during conversion
4. **Batch Processing**: When converting many files, consider doing them one at a time to avoid memory issues
5. **Verification**: After conversion, open the XLSX file to verify all data was exported correctly

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Auto-fitting columns is not available with this OS configuration"  
**Solution**: This is a warning, not an error. The columns won't be auto-sized, but the data is still exported correctly. On Linux, install libgdiplus: `apt-get install -y libgdiplus libc6-dev`

**Problem**: Worksheet names are truncated or have underscores  
**Solution**: This is expected behavior for long names or names with special characters. Excel has strict naming requirements.

**Problem**: "No data found in zip file"  
**Solution**: The ZIP file doesn't contain any CSV files that match the Glooko format. Verify the ZIP contents.
